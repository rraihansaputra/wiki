# macos - my setup

*My laptop has been described as unusable by anybody else but me. These are the parts and the reasons why it is so.*

First up: I don't use QWERTY. My keyboard is remapped to Dvorak through Karabiner-Elements (and some other tweaks). The complex modifications setup can be seen on my setup repo.  
My touchpad is configured so the bottom *left* part is the right click and tapping anywhere is a click. The scroll direction is reversed instead of natural.  

I mainly launch applications and search files through Alfred. To manage windows in a snap I use Divvy. Clipboard pastes are managed by FlyCut.  

Other stuff I have on my menubar are TextExpander (macros), Google Drive Sync, DNSCrypt, RescueTime (time tracking), Caffeine (instant no-auto sleep), and YAM Display (extend display to iPad).  

My main browser is Google Chrome with these plugins:  
- uBlock Origin (A MUST)
- Pushbullet (either on mac or chrome, I prefer Chrome)
- Vimium (for keyboard navigation, I don't use a lot)
- Youtube Popup
- OneTab
- Project Naptha (instant OCR)
- RescueTime
- News Feed Eradicator for Facebook
- Reddit Enhancement Suite
- hckrnews
- Empty New Tab Page
- Table Capture
- YouTube Queue

Will do a basic setup guide for other people. Mainly around effectivizing keystrokes and stuff.

I develop mainly using VSCode/VSCodium with iTerm2 as the terminal emulator. My terminal setup uses ZSH with Oh My Zsh! but currently moving to antibody. My zsh theme is modified from re5et to change the git emoji status to something more understandable. Color theme for VSCode currently is Monokai and Cobalt2 for iTerm. My VSCode setup can be seen on my VSCode page.
