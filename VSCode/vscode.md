# VSCode/VSCodium

VSCode/VSCodium is my editor of choice. I would prefer to have day to day on VSCodium, but alas, still on VSCode for now. I don't really mind the licensing, but it's better to be safe than not.  

The settings syncing should be handled better, but for now I'll list out my installed plugins and store a copy of my settings.json on my setup repo.  

Lol decided to use settings sync. not bad. leaving this up for later use.
